# Jena Fuseki Docker

A simple docker container for running a triple store with TDB and a SPARQL
endpoint using FUSEKI. 

This repo is inspired by the [fuseki docker](https://github.com/SemanticComputing/fuseki-docker) 
image of the [Semantic Computing Research Group](https://github.com/SemanticComputing).

It has some improvements as it is now up to date with the current versions
of Jena and Fuseki.

The unneccesary spatial index was removed.
